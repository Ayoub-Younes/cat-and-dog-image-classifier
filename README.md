# Cat and Dog Image Classifier

## Project Overview
This project is a Cat and Dog image classification model built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained to distinguish between images of cats and dogs, achieving binary classification. It uses image augmentation techniques and aims to optimize accuracy using a well-structured neural network model. The dataset contains separate training, validation, and test directories, and the project concludes with a performance evaluation through test image predictions.

## Technologies Used
TensorFlow & Keras: Frameworks for building and training the CNN model.
Python: The programming language for the overall project implementation.
NumPy: Used for numerical operations and array manipulation.
Matplotlib: For plotting accuracy and loss graphs to visualize the model's performance.
ImageDataGenerator: To handle real-time data augmentation for the training images, rescaling, and loading images from directories.
